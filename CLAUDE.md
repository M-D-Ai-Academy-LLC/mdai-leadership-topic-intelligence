# Project Configuration

## Project: mdai-leadership-topic-intelligence
M&D AI Academy — Leadership Topic Intelligence
Search analytics and SEO intelligence for discovering corporate leadership training topics.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy
- SerpAPI, Google Trends (pytrends), BeautifulSoup
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF + KMeans clustering)
- SQLite for caching and storage
- OpenAI + Anthropic for LLM features

## Git Workflow (MANDATORY)
- NEVER commit directly to main or master
- All AI/bot commits go to the `jose-ai` branch
- All human (Victor) commits go to the `victor` branch
- After pushing to jose-ai, always create a Pull Request

## AI Attribution Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
CRITICAL: Do not include any self-referential or AI-related attributions in code, documentation, or commits.
- No "Generated by Claude"
- No "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- All deliverables must appear authored by human developers

## Credential Management
Before asking for credentials, check: `/Users/vquinones/vscode/shared-apis` and `.env`

## Key Patterns
- Feature flags for all external dependencies (ENABLE_SERPAPI, ENABLE_TRENDS, etc.)
- NO_NETWORK_MODE=true for CI testing
- Strict agent I/O contracts (Pydantic types enforced per agent)
- SQLite caching with run_id + config_hash for reproducibility
- Volume is Optional[int] — not all sources provide it
