# Product Roadmap: Leadership Topic Intelligence Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This roadmap defines a 4-quarter product execution plan to move the platform from technically complete core workflows to commercially scalable product maturity. The roadmap prioritizes reliability, explainability, customer onboarding, and enterprise readiness.

The sequencing is intentional: stabilize core value paths first, then scale integrations and advanced features. This reduces rework and improves confidence in customer-facing commitments.

Recommendation: maintain a strict roadmap discipline with quarterly scope controls tied to measurable customer and financial outcomes.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Core functional modules exist and are test-backed.
- Gap-analysis API endpoint is now implemented, reducing one previously identified parity gap.
- Productization needs include UX flow hardening, packaging controls, and operational telemetry.
- Customers will expect predictable onboarding and transparent scoring logic.

### Problem and Opportunity

Without a clear roadmap, development can drift into low-impact enhancements. Opportunity is to build a focused roadmap that increases conversion, retention, and margin.

### Strategic Rationale

- Clear release sequencing improves delivery confidence.
- Feature prioritization linked to ARR goals improves resource efficiency.
- Explainability and reliability can become practical differentiators.

## 3. Analysis

### Prioritization Framework

- **P1:** Features that improve activation, retention, and ARR quality
- **P2:** Features that improve efficiency and support scalability
- **P3:** Experimental or optional enhancements

### Customer Insights Applied to Roadmap

- Buyers need fast proof-of-value and clear scoring interpretation.
- Teams need repeatable reporting and easy integration.
- Enterprise accounts require governance and auditability.

## 4. Strategy and Recommendations

- Prioritize onboarding workflow and guided reporting in early quarters.
- Add scoring explainability artifacts before advanced expansion features.
- Build enterprise controls in parallel with growth, not after scale pressure appears.

## 5. Financial Impact

- Activation-focused roadmap increases conversion and shortens payback.
- Automation and reliability improvements reduce support cost-to-serve.
- Enterprise readiness enables higher ACV deals and longer contracts.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Quarter-by-Quarter Roadmap

#### Q1: Activation and Trust Foundation

- Guided onboarding workflow
- Standardized executive report templates
- Scoring breakdown and explainability layer
- Core usage telemetry and KPI dashboard

#### Q2: Retention and Operational Scale

- Cohort-level retention analytics
- Alerting for topic momentum shifts
- Account-level usage governance controls
- Faster report generation pipeline optimizations

#### Q3: Integration and Enterprise Readiness

- API hardening and rate management
- SSO and role-based access controls
- Audit and activity logs for enterprise admins
- Data export/connectors for BI workflows

#### Q4: Expansion and Optimization

- Multi-workspace support
- Advanced scenario modeling for topic planning
- Custom scoring profiles by customer segment
- Reliability and cost optimization pass

### Resource Allocation

- Engineering: platform and reliability
- Data/ML: scoring quality and explainability
- Product: adoption instrumentation and prioritization
- QA: release stability and regression confidence

### Dependencies

- API provider constraints and usage costs
- Security/compliance implementation capacity
- Product analytics instrumentation maturity

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** feature creep beyond strategic priorities
  - **Mitigation:** quarterly roadmap gate with KPI impact scoring
- **Risk:** enterprise requirements discovered late
  - **Mitigation:** early design-partner validation with target accounts
- **Risk:** shipping speed reduces quality
  - **Mitigation:** release quality gates and regression test enforcement

## 8. Success Metrics

- Time-to-first-value (days)
- Activation and onboarding completion rates
- Feature adoption by tier
- Defect escape rate and reliability metrics
- Expansion revenue tied to roadmap-delivered capabilities

## 9. Next Steps

1. Approve Q1 scope and non-goals.
2. Define owner and delivery checkpoints for each roadmap epic.
3. Align roadmap KPI targets with financial projection model.
4. Start first release cycle and weekly execution reviews.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- Current repository modules, tests, and architecture.
- Typical product maturity patterns for B2B analytics SaaS.
- Market and buyer assumptions should be validated via design-partner interviews.

## Assumption Change Log

- Updated baseline: roadmap starts from an implemented gap-analysis API rather than a not-implemented placeholder endpoint.
- Updated execution assumption: formal PRD/task workflow artifacts support quarterly roadmap decomposition and tracking.
