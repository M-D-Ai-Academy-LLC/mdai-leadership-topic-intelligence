# Strategic Plan: M&D AI Academy Consulting and Training Offer

## 1. Executive Summary

This strategic plan defines a 12-month direction for building a scalable AI consulting and training practice focused on measurable client outcomes. The strategy combines executive advisory, practical workforce enablement, and implementation support under a unified delivery framework.

The plan prioritizes three outcomes: (1) predictable pipeline generation, (2) repeatable delivery quality, and (3) recurring revenue expansion. Success depends on disciplined execution, vertical focus, and clear performance management at weekly and monthly operating cadences.

By aligning go-to-market execution with financial controls and delivery standardization, M&D AI Academy can establish a durable position in applied AI transformation services.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Demand for AI adoption support is strong but uneven in execution maturity.
- Buyers need practical implementation pathways, not high-level strategy alone.
- Competitive alternatives are fragmented across training-only and advisory-only models.

### Problem and Opportunity

Organizations need a trusted partner to convert AI intent into operational outcomes. The opportunity is to own the middle ground between strategy, enablement, and implementation with accountable delivery.

### Strategic Rationale

- Practical outcomes are a strong market differentiator.
- Mid-market buyers reward structured delivery and clear milestones.
- Recurring advisory relationships improve growth stability and client retention.

## 3. Analysis

### Strategic Themes

1. **Outcome-Led Positioning**

2. **Vertical Focus for Relevance**
   - Prioritize industries where workflows and pain points are repeatable.

3. **Productized Delivery for Scale**
   - Standardize offers, templates, and implementation playbooks.

4. **Land-and-Expand Growth Model**
   - Entry workshop -> sprint -> retainer lifecycle.

### Internal Capability Assessment
