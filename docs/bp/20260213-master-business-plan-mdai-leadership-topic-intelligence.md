## 1) Executive Summary

The project is positioned to become a specialized B2B analytics platform for leadership-topic demand intelligence. The path to success depends on combining technical reliability with commercial discipline: focused ICP targeting, repeatable onboarding, and recurring subscription expansion.

The base-case financial model indicates ARR growth to the multi-million range by Year 3 with break-even in late Year 2 to early Year 3, assuming controlled CAC, improving gross margin, and strong retention.

Strategic priority is clear: move from feature-complete foundation to operationally repeatable product business.

## 2) Consolidated Findings

### Market

- Strong need exists for better topic prioritization in leadership training/content workflows.
- Buyers value measurable decisions, not generic trend dashboards.
- Segment focus is critical in first scale phase.

### Financial

- Subscription-led model is preferred over services-led model.
- Margin profile improves with automation and standardized onboarding.
- CAC payback and NRR are the key health indicators.

### Go-to-Market

- Land-and-expand is the recommended commercial motion.
- Direct outbound + thought leadership + selective partnerships form initial channel mix.
- Pilot-to-subscription conversion must be tightly instrumented.

### Product

- Roadmap should prioritize activation, trust, and enterprise readiness.
- Explainability is a competitive advantage in analytics adoption.
- Integration depth supports expansion and retention.

## Assumption Changes Since Prior Draft

- Core API commercialization assumption improved: `/api/gaps/analyze` is implemented and available for customer-facing API workflows.
- Delivery-governance assumption improved: PRD/task workflow artifacts are present and active in `docs/prd/` and `docs/tasks/`.
- External market-size precision assumption unchanged: directional estimates still require licensed source validation.

## 3) Integrated KPI Framework

### Growth KPIs

- ARR, MRR, and pipeline coverage
- Pilot-to-subscription conversion
- Expansion ARR

### Unit Economics KPIs

- Gross margin
- CAC payback
- LTV/CAC
- Burn multiple

### Product and Customer KPIs

- Time-to-first-value
- Onboarding completion rate
- 90-day retention
- NRR and gross churn

## 4) Combined Risk Register

- Market differentiation risk
- Data provider and cost risk
- Adoption and onboarding execution risk
- Enterprise sales-cycle timing risk
- Roadmap scope creep risk

## 5) 30-60-90 Day Action Plan

### 30 Days

- Finalize ICP, packaging, and pricing assumptions
- Approve Q1 roadmap scope and KPI baseline
- Launch first pipeline campaign

### 60 Days

- Convert first design partners
- Instrument onboarding and activation tracking
- Validate forecast assumptions against early data

### 90 Days

- Publish first customer outcome evidence
- Reforecast financial model with real conversion/churn data
- Lock Q2 execution priorities

## 6) Decision Recommendations

1. Operate subscription-first with services as acceleration layer.
2. Keep ICP narrow until retention and payback targets stabilize.
3. Tie roadmap acceptance to measurable business and adoption impact.
4. Reforecast quarterly with cohort-level actuals.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- Internal codebase and documentation in this repository.
- Directional industry assumptions for B2B analytics SaaS operations.
- External web research was partially constrained by source access restrictions; critical market-size figures should be validated with licensed databases and direct customer interviews.
