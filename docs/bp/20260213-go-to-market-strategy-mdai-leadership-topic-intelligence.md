# Go-to-Market Strategy: Leadership Topic Intelligence Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This go-to-market strategy defines a 12-month commercialization plan for `mdai-leadership-topic-intelligence` as a subscription analytics platform for leadership-topic planning. The strategy prioritizes recurring revenue, short time-to-value, and clear ROI evidence for L&D and leadership content teams.

The recommended motion is land-and-expand: paid pilot or starter subscription first, then expansion into broader planning teams and enterprise workflows. This reduces procurement friction and shortens the path to initial value.

Recommendation: focus on one primary ICP in the first two quarters, systematize conversion and onboarding, and only then broaden channel mix.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Core product components are implemented.
- Commercial packaging and repeatable sales motion are early stage.
- Buyer demand exists, but trust and proof-of-value must be established quickly.

### Problem and Opportunity

Without a structured GTM model, product capability will not convert to predictable revenue. Opportunity is to own the leadership-topic intelligence category with measurable planning outcomes.

### Strategic Rationale

- Existing features map directly to buyer pain points.
- Quarterly planning cycles create recurring engagement opportunities.
- Subscription analytics aligns with ongoing content/training strategy needs.

## 3. Analysis

1. **Direct outbound to ICP accounts**
   - Target roles: Head of L&D, Learning Strategy Lead, Content Strategy Lead
2. **Thought-leadership inbound**
   - Publish demand-shift insights and topic forecasts
3. **Partnership referrals**
   - Training providers, leadership consultants, enablement agencies

### Marketing Channels

- LinkedIn leadership content and targeted ABM sequences
- Webinars and workshop demos using real query examples
- Case-study-driven email and partner co-marketing

### Sales Process

## 4. Strategy and Recommendations

- Use a clear starter package to reduce initial commitment.
- Price by outcome and workflow depth, not only data access.
- Build ROI calculators into sales process.
- Require onboarding completion milestones for all new accounts.

## 5. Financial Impact

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

  - **Mitigation:** enforce qualification and tailor demo data sets
- **Risk:** inconsistent onboarding outcomes
  - **Mitigation:** standardized onboarding checklist and owner accountability
- **Risk:** channel underperformance
  - **Mitigation:** monthly channel ROI review and rapid budget reallocation

## 8. Success Metrics

- SQL volume and pipeline coverage
- Demo-to-pilot and pilot-to-subscription conversion
- CAC and payback period
- NRR and gross churn
- Time-to-first-value in onboarding

## 9. Next Steps

1. Finalize GTM offer matrix and pricing pages.
2. Launch first 90-day outbound + webinar campaign.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- Internal platform scope and capabilities.
- Directional GTM assumptions based on typical B2B SaaS motions for analytics products.
- External market scraping was partially restricted; assumptions should be validated with direct customer interviews and paid research before formal investment use.
