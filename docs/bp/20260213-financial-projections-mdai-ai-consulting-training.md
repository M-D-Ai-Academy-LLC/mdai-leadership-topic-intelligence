# Financial Projections: M&D AI Academy Consulting and Training Offer

## 1. Executive Summary

This financial projection outlines a conservative 12-month model for launching and scaling an AI consulting and training practice. The model uses a three-offer stack (diagnostic workshop, implementation sprint, advisory retainer) to balance upfront cash flow with recurring revenue.

The plan is designed to prioritize predictable conversion economics and controlled delivery costs. In the base case, break-even is expected between months 6 and 8, with stronger profitability in the second half as utilization improves and service delivery becomes more standardized.

The most important financial lever is conversion from entry workshop to higher-value implementation engagements, followed by retainer expansion.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Market demand exists, but buyer confidence depends on measurable outcomes.
- Revenue predictability requires a staged conversion model.
- Delivery margin improves when implementation is productized.

### Problem and Opportunity

The core challenge is balancing early acquisition spend with realistic sales-cycle timing. The opportunity is to build a repeatable services engine with high-value follow-on work.

### Strategic Rationale

- Entry offer reduces customer acquisition friction.
- Mid-tier implementation delivers core margin.
- Retainers increase revenue stability and planning confidence.

## 3. Analysis

### Revenue Model and Pricing Assumptions (Conservative)

- Diagnostic workshop: USD 6,500 per engagement
- Implementation sprint: USD 32,000 per engagement
- Advisory retainer: USD 18,000 per quarter

### Unit Economics Framework

- **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** blended channel spend / new customers
- **Gross margin per engagement:** revenue minus direct delivery cost
- **Payback period:** CAC recovered from gross contribution
- **Expansion rate:** percentage of customers moving into higher-tier offers

### Pipeline and Conversion Assumptions

- Workshop bookings ramp progressively through the year
- Workshop-to-sprint conversion: 35% (base case)
- Sprint-to-retainer conversion: 45% (base case)

### Cost Structure

- Direct delivery labor (facilitators, consultants)
- Sales and marketing spend (content, events, outbound tooling)
- Operational overhead (project management, admin, software)
- Partner incentives/referral fees

## 4. Strategy and Recommendations

- Maintain strict qualification to protect delivery margin.
- Use standardized proposal and pricing guardrails.
- Measure channel-level CAC and prioritize highest payback sources.
- Track utilization weekly and adjust staffing thresholds proactively.
- Package implementation outputs into reusable templates to reduce cost-to-serve.

## 5. Financial Impact

### Scenario View (12-Month)

- **Base case:** moderate ramp, disciplined conversion, break-even in month 6-8
- **Upside case:** faster partner contribution and higher sprint conversion
- **Downside case:** delayed close cycles and lower conversion from workshops

### Forecast Components

- Revenue by offer type (workshop, sprint, retainer)
- Direct delivery cost by engagement type
- Sales and marketing operating spend
- Monthly gross profit trend and cumulative cash position

### Break-Even Analysis

Break-even is primarily sensitive to:

1. Workshop volume and close quality
2. Workshop-to-sprint conversion
3. Delivery utilization and scope control

### Funding Requirements

Recommended operating buffer:

- 4-6 months of core operating expense coverage
- Additional contingency for campaign or staffing variability

## 6. Implementation Plan

- Month 1-2: finalize pricing architecture and financial dashboard
- Month 3-4: launch acquisition channels and start first paid workshops
- Month 5-8: optimize conversion process and monitor payback
- Month 9-12: scale partner channels and expand recurring retainers

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** low workshop conversion
  - **Mitigation:** improve qualification criteria and discovery process
- **Risk:** margin erosion from scope creep
  - **Mitigation:** fixed deliverables, change controls, and milestone gating
- **Risk:** acquisition costs exceed plan
  - **Mitigation:** channel-level performance tracking and budget reallocation
- **Risk:** uneven cash flow timing
  - **Mitigation:** milestone billing and retainer-focused expansion strategy

## 8. Success Metrics

### Financial KPIs

- Monthly recurring and non-recurring revenue
- Gross margin by offer type
- CAC and payback period
- Average deal size and contribution margin
- Burn rate and operating runway

### Sales and Conversion KPIs

- Qualification-to-proposal rate
- Proposal-to-close rate
- Workshop-to-sprint conversion
- Sprint-to-retainer conversion

### Operating KPIs

- Delivery utilization rate
- On-time milestone completion rate
- Scope change frequency and margin impact

## 9. Next Steps

1. Build a 12-month financial model spreadsheet with monthly granularity.
2. Validate baseline assumptions with first 5-10 closed engagements.
3. Set channel-specific CAC targets and stop-loss thresholds.
4. Run monthly forecast-vs-actual reviews with corrective actions.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- Internal sales and delivery data (as available)
- Public consulting benchmarks for utilization, margins, and conversion
- Market pricing references from comparable service offers
- Conservative assumptions used; recalibrate after initial execution period
