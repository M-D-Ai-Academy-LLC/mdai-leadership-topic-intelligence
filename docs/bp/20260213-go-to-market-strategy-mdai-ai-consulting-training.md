# Go-to-Market Strategy: M&D AI Academy Consulting and Training Offer

## 1. Executive Summary

This plan launches a 12-month go-to-market program for a blended offer: executive AI advisory, team enablement workshops, and implementation support for small and mid-sized organizations in the United States. The strategy focuses on practical business outcomes, not tool demos, with a clear path from awareness to paid pilot to annual retainer.

The recommended motion is a two-lane model: (1) leadership advisory for decision-makers and (2) skills activation for operational teams. This reduces sales friction by letting buyers start with a lower-risk workshop while preserving an expansion path into consulting retainers and recurring training cohorts.

If executed with disciplined weekly pipeline management and clear proof-of-value milestones, this strategy can create a predictable services revenue engine within 2-3 quarters and establish a defensible position in outcome-focused AI enablement.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Many organizations have high AI interest but low execution maturity.
- Decision-makers struggle to prioritize high-ROI use cases.
- Teams often lack practical adoption plans, governance clarity, and change management support.

### Problem and Opportunity

The market is crowded with generic AI content and fragmented providers. The opportunity is to position M&D AI Academy as the partner that translates strategy into measurable implementation outcomes using a structured framework and repeatable delivery model.

### Strategic Rationale

- Demand for AI capability-building continues to rise across non-technical business teams.
- Buyers prefer fast, scoped engagements before committing to long-term consulting.
- A structured land-and-expand model can improve close rates and lifetime value.

## 3. Analysis

### Target Customer Segments

1. **Primary Segment: US SMB and Mid-Market Services Firms**
   - 25-500 employees
   - Revenue bands with discretionary budget for training and consulting
   - Typical buyers: CEO, COO, Head of Operations, Head of Learning and Development

2. **Secondary Segment: Professional Practices**
   - Law, accounting, healthcare-adjacent administration, and consulting firms
   - Strong need for productivity, process standardization, and knowledge workflows

### Competitive Landscape

- **Large consultancies:** strong brand, high cost, slower cycles
- **Independent trainers:** low cost, narrow scope, limited implementation depth
- **Software-first vendors:** tool-centric, not outcome-centric, weaker change adoption support

### Market Drivers

- Executive pressure to improve productivity and margins
- Workforce demand for practical AI upskilling
- Growing compliance and governance requirements that require structured rollouts

### SWOT Summary

- **Strengths:** practical frameworks, integrated training + implementation, outcome positioning
- **Weaknesses:** smaller brand reach versus national firms
- **Opportunities:** high unmet demand for applied enablement in SMB/mid-market
- **Threats:** commoditized training offers and aggressive price competition

### Customer Insights

- Buyers value fast diagnostics and realistic implementation roadmaps.
- Teams prefer role-based learning over generic curriculum.
- Procurement is easier when an initial pilot has clear ROI checkpoints.

## 4. Strategy and Recommendations

### Proposed GTM Approach

Adopt a **three-stage revenue funnel**:

1. **Attract:** thought leadership content, partner referrals, targeted outbound
2. **Convert:** paid diagnostic workshop and prioritized use-case roadmap
3. **Expand:** implementation sprint, governance package, and retainer support

### Core Offer Architecture

- **Entry Offer (low friction):** 1-day executive and team diagnostic workshop
- **Core Offer:** 6-8 week implementation sprint for 1-2 use cases
- **Expansion Offer:** quarterly advisory retainer + recurring training cohorts

### Channel Strategy

- LinkedIn thought leadership and short educational assets
- Referral partnerships with IT service providers, legal/compliance advisors, and industry associations
- Targeted outbound to operations and executive stakeholders in selected verticals
- Webinar-to-workshop conversion events every month

### Sales Process

1. Qualification call
2. Discovery and baseline assessment
3. Scoped proposal with milestones and ROI hypothesis
4. Pilot delivery and measured outcomes
5. Expansion proposal and annual plan

### Success Criteria

- Consistent monthly pipeline creation
- Conversion from workshop to implementation sprint
- Expansion from sprint to retainer within 90 days

## 5. Financial Impact

## Assumptions

- Horizon: 12 months
- Average pricing assumptions (conservative):
  - Diagnostic workshop: USD 6,500
  - Implementation sprint: USD 32,000
  - Quarterly advisory retainer: USD 18,000 per quarter
- Close assumptions:
  - 10 workshop engagements per quarter by Q4 run rate
  - 35% workshop-to-sprint conversion
  - 45% sprint-to-retainer conversion

### Revenue Model (Conservative Scenario)

- Workshop revenue provides top-of-funnel cash flow and proof-of-value
- Sprint revenue drives core gross margin contribution
- Retainer revenue stabilizes recurring base and improves forecasting

### Cost Structure (High-Level)

- Delivery labor (consultants/facilitators)
- Sales and marketing spend (content, events, outbound tooling)
- Operations and enablement tools
- Partner referral incentives

### ROI and Break-Even

- Break-even target: between month 6 and month 8 under conservative pipeline assumptions
- Margin expansion expected after month 6 as reusable playbooks reduce delivery effort per engagement

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Timeline and Milestones

- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2): Foundation**
  - Finalize offers, pricing guardrails, proposal templates
  - Build sales assets and workshop curriculum
  - Recruit and onboard initial partner channel targets

- **Phase 2 (Month 3-6): Launch and Validate**
  - Run monthly webinar-to-workshop campaigns
  - Execute first wave of workshops and pilots
  - Capture case studies and refine sales messaging

- **Phase 3 (Month 7-12): Scale and Expand**
  - Increase outbound velocity and partner-sourced opportunities
  - Productize implementation packages
  - Expand retainers and introduce annual renewal pathways

### Resource Allocation

- GTM lead (owner of pipeline and partner motion)
- Delivery lead (quality and client outcomes)
- Sales support (qualification, proposals, CRM hygiene)
- Content operations support (campaign cadence and assets)

### Dependencies

- Consistent content publishing cadence
- CRM discipline and weekly pipeline reviews
- Fast turnaround on proposal and scheduling workflows

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk: Long sales cycles in mid-market accounts**
  - Mitigation: use paid diagnostic as a low-friction commercial entry point

- **Risk: Price pressure from low-cost trainers**
  - Mitigation: position on measurable outcomes, implementation depth, and governance support

- **Risk: Delivery bottlenecks as demand grows**
  - Mitigation: standardized playbooks, facilitator bench, and defined staffing thresholds

- **Risk: Unclear ROI perception by buyers**
  - Mitigation: pre-defined baseline metrics and milestone-based outcome tracking

## 8. Success Metrics

### Pipeline and Revenue KPIs

- Qualified opportunities created per month
- Workshop bookings per month
- Workshop-to-sprint conversion rate
- Sprint-to-retainer conversion rate
- Average deal size and sales cycle length
- Quarterly recurring revenue from retainers

### Delivery and Impact KPIs

- Client satisfaction score after each phase
- Time-to-first measurable business outcome
- Percentage of projects meeting milestone targets
- Referenceable case studies generated per quarter

### Measurement Cadence

- Weekly: pipeline velocity and stage movement
- Monthly: conversion, revenue attainment, channel effectiveness
- Quarterly: margin, retention, and expansion performance

## 9. Next Steps

1. Confirm target vertical priority list (top 2-3 industries).
2. Finalize service packaging and proposal templates within 10 business days.
3. Launch first 30-day campaign calendar (content, webinar, outbound).
4. Start first diagnostic cohort and track baseline metrics.
5. Hold first executive GTM review at end of month 1 and adjust plan.

## Data Sources and Assumptions

- Internal historical sales and delivery metrics (if available)
- Public market benchmarks for consulting and enablement services
- Buyer interviews and discovery-call notes
- Assumptions above are conservative placeholders and should be recalibrated after the first 6-8 paid engagements
