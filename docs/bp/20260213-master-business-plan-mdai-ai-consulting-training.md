## 1) Market Opportunity Summary

The strongest near-term demand comes from US SMB and mid-market organizations with high AI intent but low implementation maturity. Buyers want practical adoption support tied to measurable business outcomes.

### Strategic Market Insight

- Competing on generic training creates price pressure.
- Differentiating on practical outcomes and implementation quality improves win probability.
- Vertical-specific messaging is required for conversion efficiency.

## 2) Financial Model Summary

The growth engine is intentionally staged:

1. Paid diagnostic workshop (entry)
2. Implementation sprint (value realization)
3. Advisory retainer (recurring expansion)

### Base-Case Economics (Conservative)

- Break-even target: month 6-8
- Key levers: conversion quality, utilization, and scope discipline
- Financial governance: monthly forecast-vs-actual with channel-level CAC monitoring

## 3) Go-to-Market Summary

The GTM system uses a two-lane motion:

- Executive advisory lane for decision-makers
- Team enablement lane for practical adoption

This approach reduces buying friction while preserving expansion potential into implementation and retainer services.

### Channel Mix

- Thought leadership and educational events
- Partner referrals
- Targeted outbound to operations and executive roles

## 4) Strategic Execution Summary

Execution is structured by quarter to preserve focus and accountability.
