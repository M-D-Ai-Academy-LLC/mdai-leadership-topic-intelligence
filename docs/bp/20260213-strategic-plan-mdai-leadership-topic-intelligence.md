# Strategic Plan: Leadership Topic Intelligence Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This strategic plan outlines a 12- to 24-month direction for building `mdai-leadership-topic-intelligence` into a durable product business. The strategy centers on three outcomes: product reliability, commercial repeatability, and measurable customer impact.

The platform should evolve from a strong technical foundation into an operationally mature offering with clear positioning, dependable onboarding, and disciplined KPI governance.

Recommendation: sequence execution by quarter with strict scope control and measurable milestones tied to revenue quality and product adoption.

## 2. Background and Context

### Current Situation

- Strong technical baseline exists across research, scoring, and reporting workflows.
- Commercial systems (packaging, onboarding, customer operations) need further formalization.
- Documentation and governance structure now supports standardized agent operations.

### Problem and Opportunity

The key challenge is translating technical capability into reliable business growth. The opportunity is to establish category authority in leadership-topic intelligence with high switching costs created by workflow integration and historical benchmarking.

### Strategic Rationale

- Continuous topic planning need drives recurring usage.
- Proprietary workflow and scoring can create defensibility.
- Early process standardization improves scale efficiency.

## 3. Analysis

### Strategic Objectives

1. Achieve repeatable customer acquisition and onboarding.
2. Improve retention through measurable customer outcomes.
3. Strengthen product moat via better scoring transparency and integration depth.

### Key Initiatives

- Product: reliability, explainability, and report automation
- Revenue: ICP-focused GTM system and expansion motion
- Operations: KPI instrumentation and forecast discipline

### Resource Priorities

- Product/Engineering and data quality first
- Revenue operations and customer success second
- Non-essential expansion deferred until base metrics stabilize

## 4. Strategy and Recommendations

- Keep a narrow ICP through initial scale phase.
- Productize onboarding and QBR workflow to protect NRR.
- Build transparent scoring narratives to increase trust and adoption.
- Prioritize integrations with systems customers already use for planning.

## 5. Financial Impact

- Better retention and expansion should improve revenue predictability.
- Product automation increases gross margin over time.
- Controlled hiring against ARR milestones limits unnecessary burn.

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Timeline and Milestones

- Q1: finalize packaging, onboarding blueprint, KPI baseline
- Q2: close first reference accounts and publish outcome evidence
- Q3: scale acquisition and improve unit economics
- Q4: expand enterprise readiness and annual contract mix

### Responsibilities

- Product lead: roadmap execution and reliability targets
- Revenue lead: acquisition and conversion performance
- Customer success lead: adoption, retention, expansion metrics

### Dependencies

- Data provider reliability
- CRM + product analytics instrumentation
- Customer reference development

## 7. Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk:** roadmap sprawl
  - **Mitigation:** quarterly prioritization gates and strict non-goal list
- **Risk:** weak customer activation
  - **Mitigation:** onboarding SLAs and milestone ownership
- **Risk:** margin pressure from support overhead
  - **Mitigation:** self-serve reporting and operational automation

## 8. Success Metrics

- Product activation rate
- 90-day retention
- NRR and expansion ARR
- Gross margin trend
- Forecast accuracy and burn multiple

## 9. Next Steps

1. Lock FY strategic objectives and KPI targets.
2. Publish a quarterly execution operating plan.
3. Implement governance cadence: weekly operating review, monthly strategy review.
4. Reassess plan at quarter-end using cohort-level results.

## Data Sources and Assumptions
