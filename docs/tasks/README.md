# Tasks Directory

This directory stores implementation task lists derived from PRDs.

## Status

`docs/tasks/` existed but had no tracked files. This README and template were added to initialize it.

## Naming Convention

- `tasks-0001-prd-<feature-name>.md`
- `tasks-0002-prd-<feature-name>.md`

Example:

- `tasks-0001-prd-topic-intelligence-api-hardening.md`

## Workflow

1. Create PRD in `docs/prd/`
2. Create matching task file in `docs/tasks/`
3. Execute tasks and update checkboxes as work completes

## Quality Checklist

- Include relevant files section
- Include tests to add or update
- Break work into parent tasks and actionable subtasks
- Keep one task list per PRD
