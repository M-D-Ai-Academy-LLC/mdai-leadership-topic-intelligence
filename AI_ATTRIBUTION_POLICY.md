# AI Attribution Policy

## Policy Statement

All code, documentation, and deliverables produced for M&D AI Academy projects must appear as human-authored work. AI tools are development assistants, NOT co-authors.

## Prohibited

- "Generated by Claude", "Created by GPT", or any AI attribution
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar in git commits
- AI model names in file headers, footers, or metadata
- References to AI assistance in customer-facing documentation

## Required

- All deliverables attributed to human team members
- Professional provenance statements only
- Neutral language for automation references (use "proprietary automation" or "internal development framework")

## Enforcement

- Git hooks block commits with AI attribution
- CI fails builds with AI attribution patterns
- Pre-commit hooks strip AI attribution from staged files

Effective Date: 2026-01-21
Authority: Victor Quinones (Project Owner)
